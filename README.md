The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a robust deep learning  framework that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the precise  classification of tomato diseases. 

Introduction
In agriculture, the impact of technology is increasingly vital for sustainable and efficient 
crop management. This proposal addresses a crucial aspect of this intersection between 
technology and agriculture by presenting a comprehensive deep-learning solution for 
tomato disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As a staple 
food crop, Tomatoes face various diseases that can significantly impact yields and quality. 
Using the power of image processing and CNNs, this project aims to develop an end-to
end system capable of accurately identifying and classifying different tomato diseases from 
images of the leaves. By providing farmers with a reliable tool for early disease detection, 
we aspire to contribute to improving crop management practices, ultimately promoting 
healthier yields and ensuring food security.
